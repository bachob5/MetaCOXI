# COXI-DB: An integrated reference collection of metazoan cytochrome oxidase subunit-I DNA sequences

This collection is based on the integration of the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, release 142) and the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) data. Currently it contains 5,615,985 entries of metazoan COXI sequences and their corresponding taxonomic classification and metadata.

Taxonomic path available at the following seven levels with their NCBI-TaxIDs: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.

A sample file of taxonomy and metadata retrieved from ENA and BOLD is available in Sample_Metadata.tsv

The sequence lengths range is 100-3020 bp with 658 as the most frequent. Insert graph
