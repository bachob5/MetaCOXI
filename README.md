This collection is based on the integration of the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, release 142) and the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) data. 
Currently it contains 5.6 million entries of metazoan COXI sequences and their corresponding taxonomic classification and metadata.

Taxonomic path available at the following seven levels with their NCBI-TaxIDs:
Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.
