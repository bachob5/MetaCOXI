# COXI-DB: An integrated reference collection of metazoan cytochrome oxidase subunit-I DNA sequences
This collection is based on the integration of the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, release 142. ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/sequence/release/) and the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD: http://www.boldsystems.org/) data. 
Currently it contains 5,615,985 entries of metazoan COXI sequences and their corresponding taxonomic classification and metadata.

Taxonomic path available at the following seven levels with their NCBI-TaxIDs:
Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.

A sample file of taxonomy and metadata retrieved from ENA and BOLD is available in ![Alt text](https://github.com/balechbachir/COXI-DB/blob/main/Sample_Metadata.tsv)

The sequence lengths range is 100-3020 bp with 658 as the most frequent.
